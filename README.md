[ :wave: ] Hi, I'm Abhi, a 2nd Year Computer Science, Engineering, and Math Student @ UC Irvine

[ :rocket: ] I'm currently building [Opennote](https://opennote.com), building the AI foundations for the future of education. Previously, I've worked at [Browserbase](https://browserbase.com) on Web Automation AI Agents and [NASA](https://nasa.gov) on Flight Software.

[ :books: ] I'm an avid learner and explorer, and love a good challenge. I'm also a 4x Hackathon Winner (HackMIT, UCLA/LAHacks, UCI/IrvineHacks, SFSU/SFHacks)!

[ :phone: ] You can contact me via `abhi[at]opennote.me`
